            <p>Growing up in the South Bronx I never noticed the lack of regard for the quality of our air.
              In class I'd learn about the U.S. polluting other countries with factories handling our plastic, garnment manufactoring factories, and the excessive donations from stores like Goodwill, through free labor manufactoring.
              Now, I've come to realize that South Bronx residents have fallen a victim to the same disregard for human life.</p>
